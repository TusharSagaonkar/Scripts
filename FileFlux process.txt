ðŸ“„ Project Approval Procedure: FileFlux

1. Project Overview

Name: FileFlux

Purpose: Automate secure ingestion of Switch files via SFTP into Oracle Database for reconciliation and reporting.

Scope: Download files from bankâ€™s switch SFTP server, validate, store in database, and make data available for reporting.



---

2. Business Need

Current manual/partial processes are prone to delay and duplication.

Regulatory and audit teams require consistent, traceable ingestion of switch data.

Growing transaction volumes (up to millions/day) require automation.



---

3. Proposed Solution

Implement FileFlux as an automated pipeline with the following components:

SFTP Automation: Secure file transfers using SSH key-based authentication.

File Tracking: Maintain metadata (filename, hash, load timestamp, status) to avoid duplication.

Database Storage: Insert validated data into Oracle Database with proper indexing.

Recovery Mechanism: Resume from last successful file in case of downtime.

Audit & Logs: Maintain process logs for compliance and troubleshooting.

4. Technical Design

Technology Stack:

Language: Python (modular scripts)

Scheduler: Cron (Linux) or Task Scheduler (Windows)

Database: Oracle 19c (existing infra)

Libraries: paramiko (SFTP), cx_Oracle (DB connectivity), Python logging


Architecture Flow:

1. Connect to SFTP server â†’


2. Identify new files (compare with DB log table) â†’


3. Download file â†’


4. Validate structure â†’


5. Insert into Oracle table(s) â†’


6. Update metadata table â†’


7. Generate audit log/report.





---

5. Security Considerations

SFTP Key-based Authentication (no password expiry issue).

Dedicated Application User in Oracle DB with limited privileges.

File Hashing (SHA256) for duplicate detection and integrity checks.

Logging/Audit for every transfer and insert.



---

6. Resource Requirements

Infrastructure:

1 Application Server (Windows/Linux VM with Python installed).

Storage: ~100 GB for file retention (adjustable).


Access:

SFTP user with SSH key authentication.

Oracle app user with connect + insert/update/select privileges.


Human Resources:

1 Developer (Python/Oracle).

1 DBA (table design, backup strategy).

1 System Admin (SFTP + server config).




---

7. Backup & Recovery

Oracle RMAN/expdp for DB backups.

Daily backup of downloaded SFTP files.

Resume capability: system continues from last successful file in case of outage.



---

8. Testing & Validation

Pilot with one cycle/day for 2 weeks.

Compare DB records against raw switch files.

Simulate failure (server downtime) and verify auto-recovery.



---

9. Reporting

SQL-based reports for reconciliation.

Export to Excel/PDF for audit teams.

Future scope: integrate into Fincron reporting layer.



---

10. Approval Required

IT Security â†’ for SFTP setup and key-based authentication.

DBA Team â†’ for app user creation, schema design.

Operations â†’ for process ownership.

Audit/Compliance â†’ for data handling and retention approval.

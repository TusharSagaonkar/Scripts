Subject: Request for Resources to Implement Switch File Processing System

Dear [Managerâ€™s Name],

As part of the upcoming Switch File Processing system, I would like to request the following resources to ensure smooth development, testing, and deployment:

1. Server Access

One dedicated application server (Linux/Windows, as per infra standards) with Python 3.x installed.

Access to SFTP (test and production) locations for fetching files.

Scheduled job capability (cron/Task Scheduler) for automation.


2. Database

Oracle 19c schema with sufficient storage allocation for ~1M records/day (with future scalability in mind).

Permission to create tables for transaction data (switch_data), audit (file_audit), and logs (file_log).

Partitioning support for large tables to improve performance and reporting.


3. File System

Secure directory on the server for temporarily storing downloaded files before processing.

Separate directory for logs (/var/log/switch_processing/) with sufficient retention.


4. Connectivity & Security

Whitelisted network connectivity between the application server and SFTP servers.

Secure credential management (wallet or key-based authentication for DB and SFTP).


5. Other Requirements

Backup strategy for database and file system.

Access to monitoring/alerting tools (optional, but useful for production stability).



---

These resources are necessary to:

Prevent file duplication or data loss.

Ensure resilience in case of downtime.

Maintain compliance and auditability for transaction-level data.

Support long-term scalability as file volumes grow.


Kindly let me know the approval process and point of contact from infra/DB teams to move this forward.

Thanks & Regards,
Tushar
